# Google Cloud APIs

This module utilises the Google Cloud Platform, in particular the [Google Drive API](https://developers.google.com/drive/api/v3/about-sdk) and the [Google Calendar API](https://developers.google.com/calendar).

This module was used to create a Google Calendar and create events to inform users when the upcoming scheduled Instagram posts would be posted to Instagram. Functions relating to the uploading and downloading of files into one's Google Drive were also included.

## File Structure

This module is separated into three files:

1. **login.py**
    * Passes the appropriate login credentials into the Google APIs.
2. **add_calendar.py**
    
    * Schedules calendar events in a Google Calendar
3. **get_file.py**
    * Downloads particular files from one's Google Drive
