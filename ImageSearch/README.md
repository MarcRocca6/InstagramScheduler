# ImageSearch Module

This module deals with the retrieval and downloading of beer related images. Given the name of a particular beer and the brewer this module uses *Google-Images* to locate images of that beer. 

This module also performs *Google-Reverse-Image-Search* to find the original source of an image so that the original creator of that image can be properly credited in an Instagram post description if that image was to be used.
